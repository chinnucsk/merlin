# Merlin

Merlin is a mocking framework for Erlang to support Test-Driven _Design_; it differs from Test-Driven *Development*, which is the purview of e.g. eunit.

Mocking is an advanced code development technique that enables you to specify the behavior of an unimplemented module - the mock - to drive the collaboration design of the module under test. Mocking is *complementary* to unit testing, and tests behaviour as opposed to focusing purely on the 'integrity' of the module, as is the case with classical unit testing.

## Mocking is Not Just for Object-Oriented Languages

If you aren't familiar with mocking, the first most important thing to understand is that [Mocks Aren't Stubs](http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html).

Mocking was introduced in the paper [Mock Roles Not Objects](http://www.jmock.org/oopsla2004.pdf).

## State of Affairs

This project is currently in an *early beta* phase and is largely experimental. Although the programmatic interface will likely remain relatively stable, the internal implementation is subject to change.

## Dependencies

* parse_num

Github does not support 'git submodules' at the time of this writing. As a consequence, there is a copy of [parse_num.erl](https://github.com/egarson/parse_num) in the src directory. parse_num is a small module that converts atoms to numbers, which is useful for DSL development.
